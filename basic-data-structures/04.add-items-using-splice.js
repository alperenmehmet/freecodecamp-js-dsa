/*

Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, you can use the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another.

const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
console.log(numbers);

The second occurrence of 12 is removed, and we add 13 and 14 at the same index. The numbers array would now be [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ]

function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  arr.splice(0, 2, 'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond');
  return arr;
}

console.log(
  htmlColorNames([
    'DarkGoldenRod',
    'WhiteSmoke',
    'LavenderBlush',
    'PaleTurquoise',
    'FireBrick',
  ])
); // should return ["DarkSalmon", "BlanchedAlmond", "LavenderBlush", "PaleTurquoise", "FireBrick"]
