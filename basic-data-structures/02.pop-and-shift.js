/*

Both push() and unshift() have corresponding methods that are nearly functional opposites: pop() and shift(). As you may have guessed by now, instead of adding, pop() removes an element from the end of an array, while shift() removes an element from the beginning. The key difference between pop() and shift() and their cousins push() and unshift(), is that neither method takes parameters, and each only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.

function popShift(arr) {
  let popped = arr.pop();
  let shifted = arr.shift();
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete'])); // should return ["challenge", "complete"]
